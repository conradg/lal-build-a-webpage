# Lunch & Learn: Build A Web Page

Welcome to the Lunch & Learn: Code series.

Today we’ll be creating a web page. Before we start, there’s a few things we need to know about how a web page is built.

A modern webpage is made up of three distinct parts:
• HTML – a *Document* that contains the *Elements* of a web page
• CSS – *Styling Rules* that tell a web page how to present itself
• JS –  the *Code* that powers the web. When JavaScript is running on our page, it has access to something called the *DOM* (The Document Object Model) which allows it to change our HTML.

This golden trifecta of technologies, when used together, can be used to create webpages and build web apps.

For this task, I’ve provided some of the starting HTML, CSS and JS for us to work with. We’ll be creating a catalog of product items!

## Tools:
We’ll be using [Codepen](codepen.io) projects. Codepen is an in-browser code editor for the web.

## Method
I will be working alongside you to complete the walkthrough - which should be self-explanatory enough for us to go through .

## Goal
The goal of this workshop is to briefly introduce the aspects of the modern web,
