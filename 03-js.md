# JavaScript
To understand what JavaScript is, we need to understand code. Coding is the art of writing *instructions* in a *language* that the computer can understand and carry out.

The difference between HTML and JavaScript is that HTML is a markup

JavaScript is one of those languages, and it’s used for browsers.

> Another thing you’ll need when testing any of these items is to make use of the *console*.

## Variables
Variables are a box or bucket that we put values inside of.  They give a name to the things we want to use in our application and that name can be reassigned to something else!

JavaScript Values:
• *10* – the literal number ten
• *“grape”* – the string /(word)/ grape, the quotes are important
• *false* - the boolean value false /(booleans are either true or false)/
• `{ brand: "Takeaway Night", name: "Easy Lamb Biryani", tasty: true }` – an object containing a brand property and a name property, which are both strings and a tasty property which is a boolean!
• `[ "Everyday Favorites", "10-Minute Meals", "Healthy Choices" ]` – an array /(list)/ of strings.

> Look at `base/products.js` - these are the product items we’ll be showing in a second. It’s pretty big, but if you look closely they’re all made up of the value types shown above.

We assign values to named variables like so:
`const mark = "Loves Gousto's Easy Lamb Biryani"`

So if I try to find the value of mark using the console:
`console.log(mark)`

It’ll say:
`"Loves Gousto's Easy Lamb Biryani"`

> We use *const* to define a variable that’ll never change and *let* to define a variable that may change.

## Conditions
In programming languages, we can get the computer to compare things:

• `10 === 11` returns  `false`
• `10 > 11` returns `false`
• `10 < 11` returns `true`

When comparing literal, constant values – conditions aren’t that useful. Their real power shows when we compare variables and indeterminate values.

We can use an `if-else` statement to change our course of action if a condition is true or false.

> Try it out!
> Math.random gives us a floating (decimal) value between 0 and 1, let’s use it for our condition.
> Open the console with `Cmd + Option + J`

```
let schroedingersCat

if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
	schroedingersCat = true
} else {
	schroedingersCat = false
}

console.log(schroedingersCat)
```

## Functions
Functions are small pieces of code that we can define, call and invoke at will within our application.

>  Remember variables? Functions can be assigned names and passed around our program, as well.

We can define a function like this:
`const double = (number) => 2 * number`

The same function can be used by it’s name:
 `double(10)` which will return `20`

## Events
Events are sent to notify code of interesting things that have taken place. They’re triggered when something happens:
• When someone scrolls, there’s an *event* for that: `scroll`
• When someone clicks, there’s lots of *events* for that: `mouseup`, `mousedown`

In fact, the event that we’re using to see whether the page is ready for our code to run is `DOMContentLoaded`, you can see us using it in `base/helpers.js`!

Let’s identify what happens when we try and attach an event to the document:

```
document.addEventListener('mouseup', event => {
	console.log(event.target)
})
```

Paste this into the document underneath the line `document.querySelector('.products').innerHTML = productsHTML`

What do you see in your console?
